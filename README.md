## Web3 portfolio tracker

The idea of this project is to be able to track various Web3 wallets and changes in their asset structure.

In the first phase, we will enable saving of snapshots of wallet's holdings.

In the later stages, we will also add an extension which enables us to see changes in wallet's assets structure.
